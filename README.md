# BootstrapR

A use of Bootstrap technique for a Master Thesis in Statistics. Made in R.

I worked as an assistant by making a program that executes a Bootstrap method, to make comparisons againts a Shewart method, in the analisis of continuous variables that 'tends' to be discrete (by assuming a set of posible values).

The algorithm was part of a Thesis, that has not yet been published
